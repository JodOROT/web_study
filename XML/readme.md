### XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.

### XML focuses on data rather than data presentation, so essentially imports the data we need, and then we present it with another markup lanuage such as html

### XML was designed to be both human, and machine-readable.

### XML is software and hardware independent

### XML childnodes; at its most basic level just info/text contained in tags

_One of the reasons XML is popular because it focuses on data rather than data presentation. The other markup language such as HTML is used for data presentation. This separates the data and its presentation part and gives us the freedom to present the data, the way we want, once we receive it using XML._
