### XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.

### XML was designed to store and transport data.

### XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.

_One of the reasons XML is popular because it focuses on data rather than data presentation. The other markup language such as HTML is used for data presentation. This separates the data and its presentation part and gives us the freedom to present the data, the way we want, once we receive it using XML._
